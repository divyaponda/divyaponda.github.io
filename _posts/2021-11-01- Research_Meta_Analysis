# Research Meta Analysis 

## Objectives
The goal of this assignment is to develop an understanding of how to critically examine scientific studies and analyze datasets.

## Source 

The source that I used for this assignment was a scientific journal called: [The Effects of Sleep Restriction and Extension on School-Age Children: What a Difference an Hour Makes ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3696323)

## The Questions

### 1. What is the average speed (Spd) of all Digimon? 

### My Answer: 
The average speed of all of the digimon is **120.40160642570281**.

### 1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

### My Answer: 

Null hypothesis: Sleep restriction leads to improved sleep quality compared to sleep extension.

Alternative Hypothesis: For the individual child, the amount of sleep that they get has a significant impact on their NBF (Neurobehavioral functioning.) 

### 2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

### My Answer: 

The Society for Research in Child Development is collecting and analyzing this data. 


### 3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

### My Answer: 
They use tables, figures, and graphs. However, the actual/ complete datasets that they use are not available.  


### 4. Why are they interested in this data?

### They are interested in this data because they want to see how the duration that a child sleeps affects their NBF (Neurobehavioral functioning) 


### 5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

### They are recording the hours that the child has slept, sleep activity, the ages and genders of the children, sleep measures, sleep restrictions and extensions, and more. They leave out data regarding children of different age groups, and they also only include children from 4-6th grades and from Israel. They also do not track the amount of noise in the household, which could affect quality of sleep. 


### 6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

### They found that the effects of NBF on the CPT, reaction time, and memory tests impact academic performance. Thus, inefficient sleep in children can severely hurt their academic performance, and exacerbate developmental psychopathology, according to the study. 


### 7. How was this study funded?

### This study was funded by the Society for Research in Child Development and Wiley. 


### 8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

### No, I do not, as sleep in general does affect cognitive function.
