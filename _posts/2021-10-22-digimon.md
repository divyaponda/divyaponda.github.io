# Digimon!

## Purpose
In this lab, we used variables, lists/dictionaries, functions, and loops in Python code in order to examine a Digimon dataset.

## Starting Out

My first step in the process was creating the table and the nested dictionary. But before doing so, I imported and opened the digimon.csv file, and read through it. Then I created the DictReader object to go through the list. 

``` 
import csv
with open("datasets/digimon.csv", "r") as f: 
    data = list(csv.DictReader(f)) 
```

Next, I made a table to store and organize the data.Then I created a variable for each parameter that I would be using to store all of the data in the dataset for that parameter. For instance, creating the variable **"digi"** stored all of the data in the dataset for the digimon. 
```
    table = {} 
    for digimon in data:
        digi = digimon["Digimon"]
        Type = digimon["Type"] 
        attr = digimon["Attribute"]
        memory = digimon["Memory"]
        HP = digimon["HP"]
        SP = digimon["SP"]
        attack = digimon["Atk"]
        speed = digimon["Spd"]
```
Then, I added these variables to the table through using *if statements*. I used **digi** as the key in the nested dictionary, and the values of this dictionary were dictionaries, with keys of things like *HP, speed, type, etc.* In order to add these, I said that if the value of the dictionary is not in the table, then we will add one to that value for that specific species in order to account for the next term in the list. For instance HP is a value inside of the species and if a line in the data that has a specific HP for Yokomon, is not in the table, then we will add one to that value of HP, for Yokomon in order to account for that term in the list. 
```
if digi not in table:
            table[digi] = {} 
        if HP not in table[digi]:
            table[digi]["HP"]= HP
        if speed not in table[digi]:
            table[digi]["speed"]= speed
        if Type not in table[digi]:
            table[digi]["Type"]= Type
        if attr not in table[digi]:
            table[digi]["attribute"]= attr
        if attack not in table[digi]:
            table[digi]["attack"]= attack
        if memory not in table[digi]:
            table[digi]["memory"]= memory
```

## Answering the Questions
The first question that was asked of us was: 

**What is the average speed (Spd) of all Digimon?** 

In order to answer this question, I 
``` 
for digimon:
    digi++
